### Who is this blog for?

* Years ago, I had a blog called 'A Data Scientist Says' aimed at my students, but interestingly, I received more attention from data science researchers from all over the world. As a result, I gradually changed the way I expressed some ideas and hypotheses in that blog.
* Now, in this new blog, I want to take a purely technical approach, aiming to make it useful for those who want to start in the world of data, as well as for those who want to discuss and dive deeper into many of the techniques and technologies that I will be mentioning throughout this project.
* Two main points to highlight: this project, ‘The Probability and the Word’, has two main focuses. The first is related to LLMs (Large Language Models), and the second is focused on MLOps, particularly thinking about many applications in terms of Edge Computing and, more specifically, Edge Machine Learning.
  * There’s a fundamental aspect to mention: I want to take a project or two into the context of Software Engineering. I want to emphasize how to develop good system distributions, optimize images (Docker, Kubernetes), and talk about deployments.


### Why Probability and Words?

I believe I spend 90% of my time developing NLP and LLM solutions, and I’ve always been a lover of literature. That’s why many of the explanations I will bring to this blog will be connected to that—the value of words when developing solutions!


### Who is Carlos Daniel?

Hello, I’m Carlos Daniel! I define myself by my obsessions, which include computer science applied to the world of data, followed closely by AI applied to neuroscience topics, and lastly, the history of religion and its role in the macro-historical context of how these influences shape societies' behaviors. These topics cover the two sides of the coin regarding what I think about and what I develop.

Here are some random facts:


* Father of two princesses

* I am a Colombian Data Scientist and Machine Learning DevOps Engineer.

* I define myself as Caribbean because of my love for the Caribbean, the sea, and the lifestyle it brings.

* I use Mac and Linux for their good practices.

* When I want to program, I work in TMUX, and when I want to deploy, I use Pycharm.

* I have a weakness for books and literature.

* I started programming in R and Matlab.

* I have an addiction to Docker and Kubernetes.

* My favorite framework is TensorFlow.

* I work on AI programming using Nvidia’s framework.

* I use Raspberry Pi for everything that isn’t AI programming.

* Mlflow is my go-to for most of my pipelines.

* I teach Applied Machine Learning at universities in Colombia, Chile, and Argentina.

* In my pre-data life, I was a professor of General History, Religion, and Economics.

* My applied research area is psychiatric genetics and AI applications in Neuroscience.

* I’ve worked at Yale University, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the United Nations, Mercado Libre, and Globant.

* In my free time, I dedicate myself to music and literature. I am currently studying the complete works of Jules Verne as a professional reader.
