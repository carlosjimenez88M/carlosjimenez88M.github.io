### About Me 

Hello! I am Carlos Daniel, a Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Advocate and Deep Learning Engineer, passionate about developing data-driven products, especially in the fields of LLMs, AI Agents, Computer Vision, and Time Series. I have worked for the United Nations, the Inter-American Development Bank, and Yale University (School of Medicine) as an AI Engineer, creating products from scratch in the field of NLP and LLMs for various real-world applications.

I am deeply obsessed with Edge Machine Learning, using Jetson Nano for AI, and also leveraging Jetson Nano for classical Machine Learning and topics related to programming and system distribution.

Outside the world of Machine Learning, I love playing guitar or practicing powerlifting. I am an avid reader and a person devoted to the sea, as well as to my daughters.
